Reneuw: An AI-Powered Brain Stroke Rehabilitation Application
A Flutter-based Mobile Health (mHealth) Application for Stroke Rehabilitation

🧠 Remember :
The project, totaling 4.4GB, cannot be fully uploaded due to size limitations. Even with Git LFS, discrepancies persist, so the model and TFLite files are excluded from the repository. All remaining code files are stored in the `lib` and `pages` folders, including MongoDB and Voice API backend code located in the `pages` folder.

📌 Introduction

Reneuw – Rewiring Minds, Restoring Lives – is a cross-platform mobile health (mHealth) application developed using Flutter, designed to empower stroke survivors with comprehensive cognitive, physical, emotional, and lifestyle rehabilitation tools. Available for both Android and iOS, Reneuw integrates advanced AI technologies, including a voice-enabled chatbot, MRI-based stroke prediction, and gamified cognitive exercises, to provide personalized, home-based care.
Key Features:

Health Monitoring: Tracks daily water intake, meal nutrients (calories, carbs, proteins, fats, sugars, cholesterol), and body measurements (BMI, BMR, caloric needs).
Cognitive Training: Includes games like Chess, Snakes and Ladders, and Memory Match to enhance mental agility.
Emotional Wellness: Offers depression risk self-assessment and guided meditation/yoga routines.
AI-Powered Chatbot: Supports text and voice queries using LangChain and Gemini 1.5 for speech-to-text, aiding users with speech impairments.
Stroke Prediction: Utilizes a fine-tuned VGG-19 model to classify ischemic and hemorrhagic strokes from MRI scans with 94% accuracy.
News Feed: Fetches daily health articles via a News API to promote cognitive engagement.

Reneuw leverages a FastAPI backend and MongoDB Atlas for scalable data management, ensuring secure, real-time health tracking and a seamless user experience.

📝 Why This Project?

Stroke is a leading cause of long-term disability globally, affecting millions each year. Survivors often require extensive rehabilitation to regain cognitive, physical, and emotional function, but traditional clinical care is frequently inaccessible due to logistical, financial, or geographical constraints. Existing mobile health solutions lack the comprehensive, integrated approach needed for effective post-stroke recovery, particularly for users with speech or motor impairments.
Reneuw addresses these gaps by offering an all-in-one platform that empowers stroke survivors to manage their rehabilitation from home. By combining health tracking, cognitive exercises, mental wellness tools, and AI-driven diagnostics, it provides a holistic, user-centric solution. The app’s accessibility features, like voice-enabled interaction, cater to diverse needs, while its scalable architecture supports future enhancements like teleconsultation and wearable integration.

🏃‍♂️ How We Came to Solve This Problem?

Recognizing the challenges of post-stroke recovery, we developed Reneuw to deliver personalized, inclusive, and technology-driven rehabilitation:

Comprehensive Care: Tracks hydration, nutrition, and body metrics to manage stroke risk factors, while cognitive games and news articles stimulate mental engagement.
Inclusivity: The AI chatbot’s voice-to-text functionality supports users with speech impairments, and the intuitive Flutter UI is designed for elderly or motor-impaired users.
Early Detection: The VGG-19 model’s 94% accurate stroke classification from MRI scans enables timely interventions, especially in underserved areas.
Emotional Support: Depression risk assessments and guided meditation/yoga promote mental wellness, addressing isolation and stress.
Scalable Infrastructure: FastAPI and MongoDB ensure secure, real-time data management, enabling longitudinal health tracking and personalized recommendations.

Reneuw integrates these features into a single, seamless app, reducing the need for multiple tools and fostering consistent engagement in the recovery process.
